# About Me  

Hey there! I’m **Mohannad Banat**, a computer engineer who loves messing around with **software development, automation, and cybersecurity**. I enjoy both the **red and blue team** sides of security, but what really gets me excited is competing in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** events.  

I’ve been part of several CTF teams, including:  
- [PwnSec](https://ctftime.org/team/28797)  
- [JordanSec](https://ctftime.org/team/260705)  
- [bER4bb1t$](https://ctftime.org/team/177759)  
- [DeadSec](https://ctftime.org/team/19339)  

Most of the time, I’m tackling **web, reverse engineering, and crypto** challenges. When I’m not playing CTFs, you’ll probably find me on **[Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/505576)**, or solving coding problems on **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/mohnad-0b/)** and **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/mohnad0B)**.  

Right now, I work as a **SOAR Engineer & Penetration Tester** at **NourNet**, where I focus on **security automation and offensive security**.
